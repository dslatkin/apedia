              <p>Wow... A lot has changed, hasn't it? For you people who want
                this site to stay up... Here you go. I'm proud to announce the
                return of the Apedia! Though no more future changes will be made
                to the site. Though I may decide to clean up the layout. Though...
                Yeah.</p>
              <p>Well. Here you are. I bought talonz.com on leapyear day, easy
                to remember. Got some hosting from shadehost.com. They went down.
                Luckily we got our money back. Luke came back, and if Akarra ever
                decides to go back up he's more than willing to host the server.
                :) The old problem with the server was that Luke had to leave
                and left the computer in the hands of a mor...erm...person who
                decided to rip the hard drive out of the computer. Called it a
                piece of junk. Yeah, I talked to him. ._. Nothing remains of the
                server files though.</p>
              <p>Anyways Luke hosted me again (thanks!) and this'll be here or
                possibly be moved to apedia.talonz.com if I decide I want to use
                talonz.com for a portal or something. Talonz.com will host some
                of my other websites too, such as my really old personal website
                and maybe some friends' sites if they really need hosting. Here
                you have it.</p>
              <p>Bask in the memories of Whispers in Akarra!</p>
