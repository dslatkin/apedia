                <p>A hidden summoning near the Rimsin Castle was carried out a 
                  few days ago. It revealed two very high leveled monster, the 
                  Master Tarian (level 120) and the Tarian Sentinel (level 85). 
                  Very hard monsters. These have been added to the monster page. 
                  The Tarian Sentinel emits darkness, I added those notes to the 
                  Nightfighers, Djinni, and Sentinels.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Added a new weapon called the Flamebringer Glaive. It looks 
                  quite cool, but it's not worth the 40 faith requirement. On 
                  average, it'll do about an extra 10 damage on Iwids from its 
                  Item Effect. You'll be killing Iwids by the time you get the 
                  requirements.</p>
                <p>Added the screenshots to the screenshot section now! Over 30 
                  screenshots for your viewing pleasure.</p>
                <p>Also changed the Misc section on the items page to Mounts. 
                  Updated the picture of sliver of bronze. Updated menu bar because 
                  of the changes too.</p>

                <p>Added a new detail to certain monsters. Now, monsters that 
                  don't appear normally, have a little note mentioning that they'll 
                  only summoned during events or random spawns.</p>
                <p>These monsters are as followed:</p>

                <p>Lots of work done. Sorry for the lack of updates, there were 
                  some minor server issues. I have pretty much all the new items 
                  added and pages completed:</p>
                <p>&middot;Updated obelisk page with new obelisks (news ones in 
                  bold)<br>
                  &middot;Updated dungeons page with new dungeons (new ones in 
                  bold)<br>
                  &middot;Updated NPC page with new NPCs (new ones in bold)<br>
                  &middot;Updated most of the new weapon stats<br>
                  &middot;Updated most of the new armor stats<br>
                  &middot;Added ranged weapons, lights, and ammo<br>
                  &middot;Updated guilds &amp; clans page<br>
                  &middot;Added all currently known new monsters</p>
                <p>If you have any weapon stats that havn't been updated, submit 
                  them to me (see contact page). Weapons that have an asterisk 
                  (*) are still ones which NEED updating.</p>
                <p>Also, some of the armors have been given boosts, mainly shields 
                  and body armor. The ones marked with an asterisk (*) have BEEN 
                  updated. If you encounter any more armors that need updating 
                  of any kind, please contact me.</p>
