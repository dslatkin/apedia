		  As some of you may know, I am now helping with the development side of Akarra. It is fortunate for
		  me because I have the chance to show off my talent and I'm confident with my abilities. The
		  downside is that I can no longer update this site the way I used to as a "normal" player, but that
		  doesn't bother me because I've decided that the Akarrian Encyclopedia will be a semi-player-driven
		  fansite. I will perform the updates from the content that you submit to me (via email or IRC, etc).

          <P>Please note that I will not post any updates regarding maps, quests, or certain items which may
		  give clues to certain spoiler information for obvious reasons. Some time in the future I will post
		  a small section describing in detail how the Akarrian Encyclopedia will function.</P>

          <P>I also have to thank Kilala, GameJunker, Talonz, and everyone in the community for recently
		  submitting a lot of content. It's a start.....and a good one! :)</P>

		  More items and monsters have been added. Again, I want to thank everyone who has helped me by
		  giving me info, sending email, screenshots, etc.

          <P>I am aware that a few items and monsters are missing and some items I will not be adding at
		  this time. The beginners "Getting Started" guide and a few other things need to be updated to
		  reflect the changes in PA13 but I don't feel like doing it right now. I have spent countless hours
		  updating the Akarrian Encyclopedia and I need a break so I've decided that it's time for me to
		  take some time off.</P>

          <P>In the meantime, enjoy this information superhighway of a site! :)</P>

		  As usual, I've added lots more stuff so have fun and check it out :)

          <P>Many of you have asked me if I will be making a craft guide and the answer is no. I'm sorry but
		  I have my reasons....which is why I completely removed all of the quests. The Akarrian
		  Encyclopedia was not meant to be a walkthrough site. It is supposed to resemble a "game manual"
		  with a huge database of various things and ditch the walkthrough parts but still give just enough
		  information to keep the pace of excitement. It's more fun that way :)

		  I'm a little late in the day on this news but I've added another 45+ items, more NPC's, etc.

		  <P>I plan to move the scrolls from the Items section into the Skills and the Spells sections. I
		  will also be adding a Household list under the Items section for all those household items. I
		  realize that the list of items and monsters are growing so long that the load times are increasing
		  so I'll be dividing those up as well so that they don't load as many pictures on a single page. As
		  always, your help is much appreciated!</P>

		  I've added 55 items (including weapons, armor, accessories, and items) as well as NPC's, quests,
		  and a dungeon. I'm still adding more stuff so keep checking back! Thank you to everyone who is
		  helping me...you know who you are :)

		  <P>If you would like to help me find the stats for all of the items, feel free to email them to
		  me. The help is much appreciated :) Also, I do not need the entire 600K screenshot image so if you
		  want to send me images of the items through email, please crop the original .tga screenshot to a
		  smaller size with the name of the item in the body of the email along with any other info that
		  goes with it. Please do not convert the .tga to a different format because it changes the color
		  and compression.</P>

		  <P>I'm not going to list everything that gets updated because there's simply too much stuff so
		  check back often and don't forget to refresh that browser!</P>
