		  Hello everyone and welcome to the Akarrian Encyclopedia. The goal of this website is to not only
		  provide you, the player, with complete resources on every aspect of the game itself, but to also
		  integrate other fansites within the community to help promote their efforts.</P>

		  <P>The Akarrian Encyclopedia is an expansion of Akarra's Resources. This site is being developed
		  by others that help and myself (Trance). Although it is not yet complete, you can get a good idea
		  of what to expect.</P>

		  <P>Currently, most of the stats for all of the items are incorrect because PA12c was released and
		  a lot of the items were changed for balancing purposes. Keep checking back for more updates as
		  this site grows and I hope everyone has a good Christmas :)</P>
