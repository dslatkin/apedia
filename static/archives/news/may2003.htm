		  I know there haven't been many updates here recently but I'm sure you've read the current
		  situation about Khaile and his departure from the Akarra Development Team. The fact that I will
		  be filling his position prevents me from keeping this site any longer. Thus, it is finally time
		  to give up the Encyclopedia and hand it over to someone devoted enough to keep it (or the content
		  within it) alive. Reaching the 10,000 hit mark from November of last year, this website has been
		  quite an experience for me and I am glad it helped all those who have used it. The Encyclopedia
		  will make a wonderful starting package for anyone who plans to build a fansite.
		  
		  <P>I thank you Khaile for everything you've done for me and for putting up with my shit (if there
		  was any, I can't remember) hahaha! I know you will still be around but I do wish you the best of
		  luck and skill (because not everything relies on luck) in your career and your plans for the
		  future. Just remember, always expect the worst and hope for the best.....that way, you'll be
		  prepared for either situation :)</P>
		  
		  <P>As for my plans within the Chosen Heroes guild, I will be stepping down from leadership
		  position. It is obvious that I do not have the time and energy to be a leader and to help run the
		  guild as I am almost always inactive. Furthermore, it just wouldn't be fair to remain as a leader
		  hehe. I know that all of you sexy people will understand and may the guild shine on for as long as
		  Akarra lasts. LASC forever! :)</P>
		  
		  <P>Oh yeah......and ummm......NERF forever!</P>

		  I have changed all of the links over to the new design code and everything is working properly.
		  There are still a few unfinished parts such as the Screenshots, Downloads, and other various
		  things which need to be updated and I'll do that this weekend.
		  
		  <P>Oh yeah....I've decided that I'm going to keep the AE. I would appreciate it if anyone wants
		  to make anything for it. I don't care what it is, whether it be screenshots, fan art, guides, etc.</P>

		  The Akarrian Encyclopedia gets a makeover! I was never satisfied with the old design so I came up
		  with this one. The site should load much faster now because I ditched the frames and any images
		  which were set for preload. I hope you all like it because I won't be changing it again for a long
		  time :)

		  Nothing much to tell really. I actually have updated a few things such as items, page corrections,
		  and updated the WiA Sites link but I haven't been posting the news to go along with it. Sorry
		  hehe! I've been busy working on Akarra and I've also been thinking about letting someone else run
		  the site. If you want more info, you can check the WiA forums in the Chosen Heroes forum.
		  
		  <P>Then again....who knows. I just might keep it :D</P>
