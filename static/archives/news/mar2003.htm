		  I'm sure most of you have read the news on the <A HREF="http://akarra.planetqs.com" TARGET="_blank">WiA site</A>
		  in regards to Khaile's current employment situation along with the game server going offline on
		  March 21st. Don't worry though, it's only temporary (we hope) and I'm sure Khaile will find some
		  kind of solution, but I believe it's more important that he finds another job because everyone in
		  the working world knows you can't pay the bills sitting at home!

		  <P>Aside from the bad news, the good news is that PA13 is showing good signs of development. Some
		  of the new features (taken from the website) include:</P>

		  <P>Major Features<BR>
		  &middot; New tileset system for world areas<BR>
		  &middot; Active skills and spells<BR>
		  &middot; 800x600 resolution<BR>
		  &middot; Player classes<BR>
		  &middot; Player-killing rules<BR>
		  &middot; Much larger world</P>

		  <P>Minor Features and Bugfixes<BR>
		  &middot; New user interface<BR>
		  &middot; More complex quests<BR>
		  &middot; Horses doesn't wander off so far<BR>
		  &middot; Changed how monsters are added to the client (allows more monsters)</P>

		  <P>So what happens to the Akarrian Encyclopedia? More updates of course! While we wait for the
		  game server to return to life and spring back into action, I will be adding more content so check
		  back from time to time and......................go get a job Khaile :)</P>

		  It's been a few weeks since I've last updated. I've been really busy with a lot of things so I
		  didn't have time to do anything here. As always, I come through with something interesting and
		  these updates have been mostly contributed by the players :)

		  <P>&middot; Added unique weapons and armor to the lists. These unique items were provided by
		  Ruisleipa (Flamberge), Xanacon/Enquillion (Xanacon's Shortsword), Trick/Gamejunker (Quality Axe),
		  and myself (Astonishing Brush, Painter's Beret, Perfect Palette).<BR>
		  &middot; Added an accurate (but not exact) "to hit" formula in the Technical Info section (thanks
		  Enquillion!)<BR>
		  &middot; Added a Download Game mirror link in the Community section and updated/removed various
		  other links as well as creating a seperate guide for Commands &amp; Shortcuts.</P>
