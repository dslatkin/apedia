                <p>As you now know, the brand new version of Whispers in Akarra 
                  has been released. That means, I have a lot of work to do on 
                  the website. In the past week, I've been working on completing 
                  a lot of sections to get everything up to date. The things that 
                  have been completed are now as follows:</p>
                <p>&middot;Screenshots section separated into pre-alpha and alpha 
                  menues<br>
                  &middot;New alpha screenshot section is up (submit at <a href="mailto:buzzd24@charter.net">buzzd24@charter.net</a>)<br>
                  &middot;Downloads section completed, included download mirrors<br>
                  &middot;The getting started guide is now much more up-to-date<br>
                  &middot;The classes guide and tree is now complete<br>
                  &middot;Updated the commands page<br>
                  &middot;Gave each obelisk a name on the obelisk page<br>
                  &middot;Changed the random weapon so that it is now really 'random'<br>
                  &middot;Completed the guilds page (renaimed to guilds and clans)<br>
                  &middot;Equipment pages seperated into their own pages by section</p>
                <p>Also, all the nerfed weapons will be updated as time progresses. 
                  The new weapons will be added as we get them in. Contact me 
                  on IRC or in email by looking at the <a href="../../contact.htm">contact 
                  me</a> page.</p>

                <p>I changed the daily picture on the right. Hehe, sorry to all 
                  the beer fans out there. :) It's now a random weapon picture... 
                  with one weapon. I'm going to get a script to have it display 
                  a random weapon that you won't normally have an idea of what 
                  it looks like in real life.</p>
                <p>Also, submitted by Gorilla, fixed the stat requirements with 
                  the Short Spear. I added two more screenshots: The first akarrian 
                  wedding and a screenshot with a nice lighting effect in the 
                  forest southwest of the Thorns.</p>
                <p>Currently, we need some new information submitted on the minimum 
                  and maximum entry levels for the dungeons, and any other errors 
                  you encounter here. Guides can always be submitted to <a href="mailto:buzzd24@charter.net">buzzd24@charter.net</a>.</p>
                <p>In other news, everybody should have their links updated to 
                  <a href="http://www.akarra.com/">www.akarra.com</a> and <a href="http://forums.akarra.com/">forums.akarra.com</a>. 
                  Thanks to Luke, who provided us with the domain and hosting, 
                  he will also allow us to use one of his free servers in London 
                  for the game. Hopefully, this will reduce the lag greatly.</p>
                <p>On yet another side note, A1 is rumoured to be released in 
                  the following week after Luke's new server is set up properly, 
                  everything should be ready to go!</p>

              <p></p>New section completed.</p>
              <p>The new screenshots section contains three main parts. :) The 
                normal screenshots, the N'Geo Event screenshots, and the Nelly 
                Hoards screenshots.</p>
              <p>The normal screenshots can be submitted by anybody, as long as 
                they are interesting and unique, I'll put them up.</p>
              <p>The N'Geo was a surprise event that happened in Hope over a weekend. 
                A taratel was summoned and the citizens of Akarra were challenged 
                to defeat it. It put up a good fight, but Hope won in the end.</p>
              <p>The Nelly Hoards was just a day that Nelly summoned a bunch of 
                monsters. These included zombies, walking dead, skeletons, nightfighters, 
                Djinnis, imps, and even rabbits. A lot of coins that day were 
                lost. :)</p>
              <p>Enjoy the new section!</p>
