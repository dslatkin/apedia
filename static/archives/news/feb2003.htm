		  The guides are here for all to read :)

		  <P>&middot; Added the Teamplay guide in the Teamplay section<BR>
		  &middot; Added the Weapons guide spreadsheet in the Technical Info section<BR>
		  &middot; Updated the Getting Started guide<BR>
		  &middot; Updated the WiA Fansites links in the Community section</P>

		  <P>Next on the agenda is the Map Editor guide which I am working on now. If you haven't noticed,
		  any item in the Armor list with '???' in the Requirements box means that the entire row of stats
		  is incomplete. If anyone could help me out to fill in those values I would much appreciate it. You
		  can either send me an email or find me in the IRC channel :)</P>

		  No, I'm not dead....yet! A few things have happened since I've last updated the &AElig; (Akarrian
		  Encyclopedia). First, there were a couple of minor updates in WiA which included horses (yay!) and
		  a new NPC. Khaile has also released a public area editor for map-making purposes. Some of the
		  features in the map editor are restricted in the public version but that's not stopping me from
		  going wild with my imagination :) I'd suggest you get mapping and create something, especially if
		  you're the type of person who whines about when the next update will surface. It never hurts to
		  give a little in order to get a little.

		  <P>Now comes the site updates which include:</P>

		  <P>&middot; Added the News Archive section<BR>
		  &middot; Updated the NPC section in the Travel Log<BR>
		  &middot; Corrected more stats to the Weapons and Armor lists in the Index<BR>
		  &middot; Added the Charming White Flower (thank you Sorcerer!)<BR>
		  &middot; Updated the Items list with a Miscellaneous section</P>

		  <P>My next updates will focus on the guides. I will finally be adding a Teamplay guide in the
		  Teamplay section and a Weapon guide in the Technical Info section. Braiba has written the Teamplay
		  guide and Ruisleipa has created the Weapon spreadsheet which contains a wealth of technical
		  information about weapon stats, strength and damage calculations, etc. I thank you both
		  tremendously for creating these guides! :) I also plan to create a detailed map editor guide for
		  anyone who wants to get serious with it.</P>
