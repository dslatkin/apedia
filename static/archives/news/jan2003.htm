		  Hi everyone! I've been very busy for the past couple of weeks so updates haven't been happening.
		  Yeah, I know.....it's that thing they call a "life". Just a few things to note:

		  <P>&middot; Updated the accessories, weapon, and armor lists to reflect the changes in PA-12d.
		  Some stats are still incomplete. If you find any mistakes, please email me :)
		  <BR>
		  &middot; Updated the Commands and Shortcuts section of the Getting Started guide to reflect the
		  new changes also in PA-12d</P>

		  <P>Our Chosen Heroes clan has been granted a forum in the WiA forums by Khaile (thanks Khaile!) so
		  all CH members should use that forum from now on. The links have been changed under the Community
		  menu.</P>

		  <P>I thought I would mention that this website's overall rank from gostats.com web counter is
		  1,235 out of 57,400 websites that use this counter......which is not bad at all for a "hits per
		  day" rank!</P>

		  Whispers In Akarra version PA-12d has been released. It contains new chat features/commands,
		  changes in the PvP system, a new area for lower level players, and the usual bug fixes. Go
		  download it!

		  A big thanks to Imalunatic for finding our guild a decent forum :) The Chosen Heroes Forum is up
		  and running and can be found under the Community menu. Some sections are still being weeded out
		  but that's to be expected as we are still configuring it. You may also use this forum to post on
		  the Akarrian Encyclopedia board regarding this website.

		  <P>In case you haven't noticed I started to spice up the design a bit. I also added the Hype Zone
		  section under the News menu. It's currently a work in progress though ;)</P>

		  Hey everyone. First I must apoligize for how slowly this page has been loading recently. I tried
		  contacting my ISP and basically all they could tell me was "It's fine on our end, we don't see a
		  problem" which is total BS because I don't see how myself and many others could all be wrong, but
		  that's tech support for ya!

		  <P>The Teamplay guide should be up soon. It will consist of Fellowships, Clans, Guilds, and PvP.</P>

		  <P>Maps, maps, and more maps. Delaque is still working on his site Akarra's Dungeon Master which
		  will feature nicely hand-drawn maps of the dungeons in WiA along with other information. In the
		  meantime, Pheobos has been making maps of his own by piecing together actual screenshots. I've
		  seen examples of each design tactic and they look very well done. Hopefully those will be
		  available soon :)</P>

		  <P>So...what now? Nothing much except to sit back and wait for the release of PA13. Everyone knows
		  how waiting can be such a boring process but it's something we have to deal with. I was thinking
		  about adding a "Hype Zone" to the News menu to help ease the waiting. The Akarrian Encyclopedia is
		  lacking this kind of excitement. The Hype Zone (or Mystery Zone as I would call it) would feature
		  any and all news, sneak previews, teasers, and anything else which could be permissively added to
		  give everyone a taste of the WiA future :)</P>

		  <P>1) Zatra's Ring has been nerfed to +0.5 Damage Reduction<BR>
		  2) The Golden Necklace item requirements have been changed<BR>
		  3) Centipedes have been buffed</P>

		  The rest of the site is coming along well:

		  <P>&middot; Updated the WiA Sites, Special Thanks, and Contact Me pages<BR>
		  &middot; Added the Sweet Nasty Brew to the Items list<BR>
		  &middot; Updated other minor things to various pages</P>

		  <P>Lately my ISP has been very flakey so the pages are loading slowly. What do you expect,
		  everyone is back to work from the holiday vacation :P</P>

		  <P>The only thing left to tackle now is the Guides section. If anyone would like to help me write
		  the guides then feel free to contact me or submit some content and I'll fit it in as best I can.
		  If there is anything on this site I am missing (such as an item or a fansite, etc.) then please
		  let me know.</P>

		  More updates:

		  <P>&middot; Added 3 more monsters to the Beastiary bringing it to a total of 112 known monsters<BR>
		  &middot; Added the Stone Mace (thanks Timotheus!) to the Weapons list<BR>
		  &middot; Added the first animated picture of Bekarton's Hammer (thanks Pluto!) and other
		  animations will follow</P>

		  <P>Say goodbye to your book leveling days :P Khaile has discovered a bug related to Animated
		  Books. Animated Books are summoned creatures and summoned creatures aren't supposed to give huge
		  amounts of experience like they always have.</P>

		  <P>As always, thank you to everyone who has helped me to gather more images and statistics for the
		  lists :)</P>

		  There will be an event today to save the lands from the dreaded Darklings east of the Rimsin
		  Glades! I know I'll be there to help kick some major butt :)

		  <P>I've also made some needed changes to the site:</P>

		  <P>&middot; Changed the menu to load faster<BR>
		  &middot; Updated some of the Index lists<BR>
		  &middot; Fixed a lot of pictures in the Beastiary</P>

		  <P>I've removed the "item mixes" and "how to acquire" items from the Index lists. Sorry but that's
		  the way it goes. I feel it is better not to just give away the entire game like a walkthrough. I'm
		  beginning to work on different sections now but it's a lot of work so bear with me.</P>

		  I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas and a great new year! I'm back to work on the
		  encyclopedia some more and wanted to point out a few things.</P>

		  <P>As many of you know, Pluto and I have found the secret of the Dull Warhammer but I won't be
		  adding any spoiler information about it. I don't want to ruin it for everyone as I've done enough
		  spoiling on this site already. Too much time and effort went into figuring out the secret to just
		  blurt it out freely with no payoff. You would feel the same way if you were in my shoes. All I'm
		  asking is that you try and figure it out for yourself. If we can do it, so can you! :)</P>

		  <P>For reasons stated above, The Akarrian Encyclopedia is intended to be a resource, not a
		  walkthrough, which is why I will be removing a lot of spoiler information. It's not fair for the
		  developers who work so hard in their spare time to create fun things for people to figure out and
		  then I turn around and post it all here. If I keep doing this, the Akarra community will be
		  bugging the shit out of Khaile and the other devs that "there isn't anything to do" or that "the
		  game is boring" because I ruined for everyone.</P>

		  <P>Braiba has decided to help out with some of the guides. Soon there will actually be some under
		  the Guides section. Thanks Braiba!</P>
