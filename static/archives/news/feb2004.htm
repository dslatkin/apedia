              <p>Well, well. A lot has happened since two months ago. I was only
                supposed to be gone for one month, but it was doubled since a
                lot of crud came up from moving. I eventually came back on December
                25. I downloaded akarra onto my dad's 98 computer. Better than
                nothing? I couldn't update the site, since all the information
                is on my computer (mine, the one I'm using right now). So we moved
                last week. I just got my computer up.</p>
              <p>As most of you have heard, akarra is going down. If you havn't
                go to <a href="http://www.akarra.net/">www.akarra.net</a> and
                read the update. Luke ran off and disappeared in October, so the
                server had been wobbly. Then Khaile took it over and it was only
                up for about 9 hours a day. Khaile has been helping with it for
                a long time, and now he's had to give up. Since Whispers in Akarra is
                now off the line, I'd like to thank Khaile for making and creating
                the game with his fabulous ideas, and Trance for his tremendous
                effort for trying to revive this awesome game, and succeeding
                in preserving the memory of it!</p>
              <p>The Apedia will remain as it is, but I have one more update.
                The update will include a lot of revamping, perfecting, and content
                to the site. Now that the game is down, I will post what spoilers
                I have when the next update comes up, too.</p>
              <p>Apedia will eventually be moved to ae.apedia.com. Luke hosts
                me, so I'm in the same situation the server was in, and need a
                new domain with new hosting.</p>
              <p>Right now I'm sitting on the floor of my new room, typing up
                an update. Goodnight.</p>
