<P>This guide will explain the basics to get yourself familiarized with the game. If you're new to Akarra,
the information below will be of great help. Advanced players may also find this information useful.</P>

                <P>You are not allow to create accounts manually when you start 
                  playing <a href="http://www.akarra.com/">Whispers in Akarra</a>. 
                  This is because Akarra is a very special game with a very special 
                  feel and pace. Instead, you'll need to connect to the game using 
                  the &quot;anonymous&quot; accounts and search out the NPC (non-playable-character) 
                  called Cecilia Lifebringer. She will help you create a new account.</P>
                <P>To connect to the anonymous account, you enter anon as the 
                  username and anon as the password. If the account is already 
                  bing used by another new player, you can use anon1, anon2, anon3, 
                  anon4, or anon5. All anon accounts have anon as the password.</P>

<P>The equipment slots displays any weapons, armor, and items you are currently wearing.
To equip an item, simply drag it from the backpack and onto the equipment slots. It doesn't matter which slot
you drop it in because the item will automatically be placed into the correct slot (if equippable).</P>

<P><STRONG><U>BACKPACK</U></STRONG></P>

<P>Your backpack holds all of your weapons, armor, items, food, etc. For every 10 levels of
experience you achieve, you will gain 1 extra row of 5 empty slots. The maximum amount of rows you can acquire
is 6 (30 empty slots total).</P>

<P><STRONG><U>MONEY</U></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Coins:</STRONG> Displays the amount of coins you have / the total amount of coins you can hold. Coins are
divided into 3 currencies: copper coins (cc), silver coins (sc), gold coins (gc).</P>

<P>Do not worry about converting your coins. The game will automatically do it for you.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Drengel:</STRONG> It costs 15cc to buy a drengel and 
                  8cc to sell one. If tranfered 50 at a time, a drengel is worth 
                  9.9cc.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Quats:</STRONG> It costs 15cc to buy a drengel and 
                  8cc to sell one. If tranfered 50 at a time, a quat is worth 
                  9.9cc.</P>
                <P><strong>Selling Your Drengel &amp; Quats:<br>
                  </strong>1 = 8cc<BR>
                  10 = 95cc<BR>
                  50 = 4sc and 95sc</P>

                <P>Displays all of the skills and spells that you have learned. 
                  To learn a skill you must find a Skill Scroll and read it. To 
                  read a scroll simply drag it from your backpack to your equipment 
                  slots (or you may "use" the scroll on yourself in the same manner).</P>
                <P>In order to assign a passive skill or spell, click the icon 
                  next to the gem slots. This will assign it to your active list. 
                  To change lists, press ctrl-1, ctrl-2, or ctrl-3. If the skill 
                  or spell is already in a different list, it will be moved to 
                  the active list. Once skills or spells are assigned to a list, 
                  use the tab button to switch between the skills or spells. Click 
                  the skills button to use the skill or spell, or press ctrl-s 
                  to use or cast the skill or spell.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>UNASSIGNED PROFICIENCY GEMS</U></STRONG></P>

                  A skill can have up to 5 gems, one of each color. You receive 
                  new gems as you progress levels (1 gem every level and 2 gems 
                  every five levels). To get a description of the skill or spell, 
                  click the name of it. On that page you will read what it does 
                  and often with a guide (ie - 1 gem for every 5 levels).</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/guides/getstarted/quests.gif" ALT="Quests Button" WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="17"></P>

                <P>This menu keeps track of all your quests, their objectives, 
                  and the ones you have finished. To obtain a quest talk to a

<P>If you're not sure what to do, please read the short summary below. I'm not going to go into full details
on this, but it should be enough to get you started.</P>

<P>You begin in the city of Hope. Your first objective should be to talk to Nicholas the Elder. He will
provide you with some important information so listen very carefully to what he says. He also provides you
with your first quest.</P>

<P>After speaking with Nicholas, head south-southwest on the trail as he has instructed and you will find
Rupert the Farmer. Rupert also gives you a quest.</P>

<P>At this point you should fight rabbits and rats to gain a few levels. After you have completed Rupert's
quest, the world is yours for the exploration. Head north onto the peninsula and explore everywhere. If you
meet a few other players on your journey, it would be a good idea to form a group and create a fellowship.
Fellowships will help you to grow strong quickly and they are a key to survival.
