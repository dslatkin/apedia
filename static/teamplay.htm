<P><STRONG><U>General Info</U></STRONG><BR>
Fellowships are the best way to increase your level in WiA and allow you to become part of the growing
community. The big advantage of fellowships is that you can take down bigger monsters and reap the rewards
in the form of experience as well as money. When you are in a fellowship with other people you get much less
of an experience drop-off from enemies which are of a higher level than everyone in the group, allowing you
to level up quickly and possibly gain a high rank on the 'Top 50 Fastest Level-50-Characters' table which
can be found <A HREF="http://akarra.planetqs.com/statistics.htm" TARGET="_blank">here</A>.</P> 

<P><STRONG><U>Finding a Group</U></STRONG><BR>
Playing WiA alone is all well and good, but in order to take down bigger foes, get better items, and earn
more experience you'll need to fight in a group. Obviously you want to find people who are about the same
level as you. If you click the <IMG SRC="images/guides/teamplay/friends.gif" ALT="People Button" WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
button you can see the level of all the players who have unlocked their level. To learn more about locking
and unlocking levels (as well as your email address, position, and stats) please refer to the
<A HREF="commands.htm">Commands Guide</A>. The other information, however, is only available
through the /finger command. The /finger command is also explained in the <A HREF="commands.htm">Commands
Guide</A>.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Creating/Joining a Fellowship</U></STRONG><BR>
To create a fellowship, click the <IMG SRC="images/guides/teamplay/fellowship.gif" ALT="Fellowship Button" WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
button and click 'Create Fellowship' then type the name of the fellowship you want to create. To join a
fellowship, do the same, but click 'Join Fellowship' instead. You can only be a member of one fellowship at
a time.</P>

<P>Once you have joined a fellowship, the fellowship menu will change to show the health and coordinates of
the members in your fellowship. Below that, the 5 faith colors are listed with either 'set' or 'cleared'. If
there is an odd number of people of a color in your fellowship it will be 'set', otherwise, it will be
'cleared'. Different patterns of 'set' and 'cleared' may give your fellowship different fellowship powers.
If you have one of these fellowship power bonuses, it will be listed below the colors.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Communicating in a Fellowship</U></STRONG><BR>
When you're in a fellowship it is generally useful to click the <IMG SRC="images/guides/teamplay/options.gif" ALT="Options Button" WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
button, click 'Set Chat Prefix', and type '/f' (without the tic marks). This will place the /f prefix before
everything you type so that you don't have to keep typing /f over and over again when you want to talk in
the fellowship. This means that even if you get separated you can still communicate without having to use
/tell (or /t) command for each person in your fellowship. It also means that people who aren't in your
fellowship won't overhear your private conversation. If you want to talk normally to someone who isn't in
your fellowship you can either delete the chat prefix or press '.' to stop the '/f' appearing. Despite this
relatively easy method, it is likely you will still see many people forget about it, so if you notice it be
sure to remind the person that the person they are talking to can't hear them.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Fighting in a Fellowship</U></STRONG><BR>
When your fellowship defeats a monster, your fellowship's experience bonus is added to it and then it is
divided equally between the members of your fellowship. The experience bonus will increase with the size of
the fellowship. Generally it will increase by 25% for each person beyond the first, however some fellowship
powers will also increase this bonus.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Dividing the Loot</U></STRONG><BR>
When you're in a fellowship the money and experience you receive is automatically divided between the
fellowship members, however, the items are not. Listed below are a few methods commonly used to solve this
problem.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><EM>Note: WiA contains a loot protection system so that other players may not steal items
dropped from monsters you've killed. The same holds true for fellowships but the loot protection treats the
entire fellowship as a single player. In other words, it doesn't matter who kills the monster while you're
in a fellowship. Any member of the fellowship may still pick up the item dropped from it.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>The 'Survival of the Fittest' Method:</STRONG> The highest-level person who can use the item and
doesn't already have one gets it. If nobody can equip the item then the closest person to being able to
equip it gets it. If everyone already has the item then the lowest level character gets it. This is based on
the idea that the higher-level characters need to kill stronger monsters and thus need to be better
equipped. The lowest level characters get the items that nobody wants so that they can sell them because the
money will be more useful to them, relatively speaking.</P>

<P><STRONG>The 'Auctioning' Method:</STRONG> The people who want the item bid an amount of money, which they
must pay the rest of the party. This is generally a good method to use when you can't decide who gets an
item because everyone benefits from it, however, in a larger fellowship the amount of money each other
player receives can be quite small. Sometimes, in certain situations when rare and valuable items are
dropped by a monster, people also offer to come back and help the others get the item in addition to the
money. This should only be done if you think you can trust the person. Most players in WiA are quite honest
but there are always a few out there who only seek to take everything for their own personal gain.</P>

<P><STRONG>The 'Finger on the Button' Method:</STRONG> Whomever picks it up first gets it. There are
obviously major problems with this method (which can cause a lot of negative attitude towards one another)
and it should only be used if you're doing it for fun, meaning that everyone in the fellowship has agreed to
this kind of behavior.</P>

<P><A NAME="clans"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><U>CLANS</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U>General Info</U></STRONG><BR>
A clan is a group of people who have banded together to form a long lasting group. A clan must consist of 5
leaders (in order to be created) and as many members as you want. Members of a clan receive a % experience
bonus depending on the power of the clan (clan leaders get a much bigger exp bonus than clan members). The
clan power is calculated by the amount of experience the members have received (in total, not just since
they joined the clan) and is visible on the statistics page. The clan power shown on the statistics page is
the power the clan had when the page last refreshed. Even when you are not a member of a clan, you can still
use the '/glist' command to see the list of the people belonging to the clan. The clan leader's
names appear in purple. If you don't know the name of a clan, you can use the '/gtag' command to find the
clan name. Refer to the <A HREF="commands.htm">Commands Guide</A> for details on those
commands.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Creating a Clan</U></STRONG><BR>
Before you can create a clan, 5 people must be in a fellowship. The total cost is 30gc (equal to 300sc or
30,000cc) between all 5 players. The creator of the clan (or main leader) contributes 10gc and the other
four players contribute 5gc. If everyone has the sufficient funds, you can create the clan with the
'/gcreate' command. Keep in mind that a clan leader may not be kicked out by another clan leader. The only
way to remove a clan leader from leadership position is if the clan leader leaves the clan entirely.</P>

<P>When creating the clan, you will be asked to enter the name of your clan, the tag, and the tag color. The
tag can be a maximum of 4 characters and will appear beside the name of your members in the
<IMG SRC="images/guides/teamplay/friends.gif" ALT="People Button" WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"> menu.
Also note that you cannot see your own tag when you hover the mouse cursor over your character. Refer to the
<A HREF="commands.htm">Commands Guide</A> for a list of all clan/guild commands.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Joining a Clan</U></STRONG><BR>
If you want to join a clan use the '/gjoin' command and your name will be added to the clan's pending list.
After the clan leaders make a decision, you will either be thrown off the pending list (refusal to join) or
accepted into the clan. Be patient when waiting for a decision because it doesn't always happen in 2 seconds!</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Belonging to a Clan</U></STRONG><BR>
Belonging to a clan allows you to use the '/g' command, which works in exactly the same way as the '/f'
command, except that it sends your message to the rest of your clan. You can also use the '/gleave' command
to leave the clan.</P>

<P>This section will be completed when guilds are added to the game.</P>

<P><A NAME="pvp"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><U>PLAYER vs PLAYER</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P>In PvP matches, you and the other members of your faith must band together to try and take down the other
faith. When you are assembled at Hope before the PvP match, you should try and take a look at the
<A HREF="http://akarra.planetqs.com/statistics.htm" TARGET="_blank">statistics page</A> to try and evaluate
your opponents. The strongest people should generally be taken down first, as they will cause the most
damage. Listed below are a few tactics which may help you win your victories.</P> 

<P>If you have enough people you could try and do a defensive strategy where the people with lots of health
protect the weaker characters while they rest. There are three places where this is most effective (due to
the positioning of the pillars). The middle of the arena is clearly the best place as it only takes 4 people
to form a wall and you can have three people behind each set of two, ready to jump in when someone is
weakened. You could also have two of the three with spears so they can attack and stay reasonably safe. If
you fail to secure the middle point you could also use the line across the two pillars at your end of the
arena (or the enemy's end if you can manage it). This will require six people to barricade, leaving only
four people to come in when they are in critical. The best way of arranging this is to have two people
behind each pillar, so that they can replace people from the section on their side, but also replace the
people in the middle section. These tactics may or may not be effective. It all depends on the cooperation
of the team.</P>
