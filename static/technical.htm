<P>This page (as it grows by player submissions) will dive deep into the technical understanding behind
Whispers In Akarra. Many people are always in search of technical information when it comes to finding out
which items are best for certain classes, experimenting with different characters, and quite simply...the
math behind it all.</P>

<P>This Excel spreadsheet is an excellent resource for comparing weapons matched to your current strength
as well as other damage factors. Not only does this spreadsheet show the weapon's statistics and which
weapons are the best, but it will also calculate how much damage each weapon will do in combat
(depending on the values you enter). Simply enter your strength in the 'Strength' cell located in the upper
right-hand corner. You may also enter any other damage bonuses from items such as armor, amulets, rings,
etc. in the other cells located beneath it.</P>
