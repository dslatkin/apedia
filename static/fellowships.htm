                  people to fellowship with</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
                <P>Naturally, a fellowship with just one person is rather pointless. 
                  The more, the merrier, and everyone should try to the the merriest 
                  :)</P>
                <p>If you find someone who is killing the same type of monsters 
                  as you (not the same monsters, I doubt you want to FS with a 
                  killstealer), that you want to FS with, start by saying &quot;hi&quot;, 
                  &quot;hey&quot;, &quot;hello&quot; or whatever suits you. Just 
                  to be a bit civil and not ask for FS the first thing you do. 
                  After the hi process, you can ask for FS without feeling like 
                  a rude bastard ;)</p>
                <p>If they ask you for the name, give it to them with a /t. Why? 
                  Because you don't want uninvited people in your fellowship. 
                  What I mean is, someone might overhear if you say it normally.</p>
                <p>If someone wants to solo you should of course respect that...<BR>
                </p>
                <P><A NAME="section2" id="section2"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><U>FS 
                  behavior</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
                <P>First thing you do, go to options &gt; set chat prefix and 
                  type &quot;/f&quot;. This means that all your messages will 
                  automatically begin with /f, the command for talking to the 
                  fellowship. It's very annoying for other players having to read 
                  what is meant for your fellowship alone to see.</P>
                <p>Ah, and the loot thing. Turn off the greed machine - if you 
                  play together and kill monsters together, you should divide 
                  the loot equally. Start by asking your fellowship members how 
                  they want to divide the loot. If they say FF, this points towards 
                  a greedy behavior. Being able to click an item the second it 
                  was dropped is not something that will avail you much on the 
                  road ahead. Being able to play in a team, on the other hand, 
                  is.</p>
                <p>Taking turns, or claiming certain drops (only to be done if 
                  you need* the specific item) is how high level people solve 
                  things. I'm not saying that it's written anywhere that we do 
                  it the &quot;right&quot; way, but you are bound to make enemies 
                  if you refuse to can't do something as simple as sharing.</p>
                <p>* To &quot;need&quot; an item means that you need it for a 
                  greater purpose than mere money. A quest, a craft ingredient, 
                  but not for selling.</p>
                <p>Ask your FS how they want to divide the loot. If they refuse 
                  to take turns, well, find comfort in the fact that they won't 
                  get into any decent clans.</p>
                <p>Taking turns works this way for a three people FS:</p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>FS Founder - Joiner 1 - Joiner 2 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>That's the order they get drops. Now, if FS Founder and Joiner 
                  1 gets a drop, it looks like this:</p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>Joiner 2 - FS Founder - Joiner 1</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If a guy called Joiner 3 joins, the list would look like:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Joiner 2 - FS Founder - Joiner 1 - Joiner 3</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Get it? Good.</p>
                <P><A NAME="section3" id="section3"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><U>Fellowships and 
                  experience </U></STRONG></FONT></P>
                <P>Some people refuse to FS or take people into their FS because 
                  they think they will gain less experience. In some aspects, 
                  this is true, but in most, it isn't. If you have any experience 
                  of basic mathematics you can think two-dimensional.</P>
                <p><em>It's not about experience gained per kill, it's about experience 
                  gained per unit of time.</em></p>
                <p>Look at this example. Dumbass1 and Dumbass2 are camping a spawn. 
                  The spawn consists of two non-cooperative monsters that give 
                  100 exp (we assume that Dumbass1 and Dumbass2 are of the same 
                  level). Dumbass1 and Dumbass2 are not in a fellowship. Ah, and 
                  the monsters respawn!</p>
                <p>Since Dumbass1 and Dumbass2 both agreed that a fellowship would 
                  mean less experience, they decided to split the monsters. So, 
                  Dumbass1 and Dumbass2 attack and kill one monster each, barely 
                  managing though. They both get 100 experience each, and both 
                  risked getting killed.</p>
                <p>Now, if they were in a fellowship...</p>
                <p>The fellowship would grant them a 25% experience bonus (an 
                  additional 25% should they create the FS power &quot;The Void&quot;) 
                  which would mean 62,5 experience per kill. But, they could kill 
                  them one by one with little problem, and in the end, they'd 
                  both get 62,5 + 62,5 = 125 experience each, as opposed to 100, 
                  and in a much faster and safer way. </p>
                <p>The two FS members, now renamed Smartass1 and Smartass2, got 
                  some spare time after killing that spawn and decided to take 
                  on a harder spawn. And look, they managed to kill it, which 
                  they never would have done alone! This gave them even more experience. 
                  Unity gives strength. Remember that.</p>
                <P><A NAME="section4" id="section4"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><U>Different 
                  roles in a Fellowship</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
                <P>Well, there are fighters, clerics and mages. Each have their 
                  own task.</P>
                <P><strong><u>FIGHTER</u></strong></P>
                <p>The fighters' job is to make sure that the weaker fellowship 
                  members (mages and clerics) don't get hit. A cleric is useless 
                  if he has to heal himself. A mage is meant to stand back and 
                  blast the monsters into oblivion. If a mage got enough HP to 
                  withstand all those hits, he simply wouldn't even be half as 
                  powerful. To tank is the job of fighters. Of course they deal 
                  a fair amount of damage as well...</p>
                <p>The fighters' choice of weapon depends on how the FS looks. 
                  If it's a 1 fighter/1 cleric FS, he should use a weapon that 
                  deals a lot of damage (since with a shield he'd just run out 
                  of stamina, and the cleric would have nothing to do since the 
                  fighter would hardly get hit). A two-handed weapon would deal 
                  a lot of damage, and let the cleric heal the damage he takes 
                  due to his lower AC.</p>
                <p>If there are multiple fighters, they should focus on shields. 
                  Many fighters means that more need revitalize and the cleric 
                  will have less MP left for healing. But since there are multiple 
                  fighters, their stamina is less likely to run out. If the cleric 
                  is good enough, he/she can make sure that the FS has to rest 
                  like 10 seconds after each battle!</p>
                <p>There's also another aspect to sword/shield fighters versus 
                  two-handed weapon users. The sword/shield fighters generally 
                  have higher AC but lower damage compared to the two-handed weapon 
                  users. This means that the S/S fighters should absorb as many 
                  hits as possible, because otherwise the 2H fighters would have 
                  to pull out due to low HP and thus not be used at their full 
                  potential. The point is, if a two-handed weapon user is getting 
                  hit, make sure that you as a S/S fighter attack the monster 
                  attacking him/her, thus provoking the monster to attack you 
                  instead. Tanks tank, two-handed weapon users deal the majority 
                  of the damage.</p>
                <P><strong><u>CLERICS</u></strong></P>
                <p>Clerics make sure the fellowship is protected against whatever 
                  peril that lurks ahead. For example, if they are fighting spiders, 
                  the cleric has protected the FS vs yellow magic and he/she is 
                  ready to cure poison. Clerics should always have a high amount 
                  of gems in cure wounds and revitalize though.</p>
                <p>Read the fighters section for information on how to use your 
                  spells depending on fellowship size.</p>
                <P><strong><u>APPRENTICES</u></strong></P>
                <p>Apprentices and wizards have two useful spells as of now: Lightning 
                  Zap and Flare. Entangle isn't that good because you more often 
                  than not entangle your own fellowship members.</p>
                <p>The use of Lightning Zap is pretty obvious: Use it on the monster 
                  the fellowship is currently trying to kill.</p>
                <p>Flare, on the other hand, is a key spell with more use than 
                  many think. When you are in a dark dungeon, fighting monsters 
                  that don't give off light, this means that someone needs to 
                  provide this light. Now, if there's a cleric in the fellowship 
                  they usually carry a light source, but if not, it means that 
                  a fighter has to be less effective since they have to wield 
                  a lousy torch.</p>
                <p>Do it like this: The fellowship leader (preferrably a fighter) 
                  walks around with a light source. When he spots a spawn, the 
                  mage casts flare on that spawn, freeing up the fighter's shield 
                  slot so he can put a shield there, or wield a two-handed weapon. 
                  And then you kill the spawn in whatever manner you like ;)</p>
