simply press F8 or click the People menu. Administrators have a &curren; beside their name.</P>

<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> If you have IRC, log onto the Quakenet server, join the #Akarra channel, and ask for an account.</P>

<P><A NAME="exploring"></A><FONT SIZE="3"><STRONG><U>EXPLORING THE WORLD</U></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P>If you're not sure what to do, please read the short summary below. I'm not going to go into full details
on this, but it should be enough to get you started.</P>

<P>You begin in the city of Hope. Your first objective should be to talk to Nicholas the Elder. He will
provide you with some important information so listen very carefully to what he says. He also provides you
with your first quest.</P>

<P>After speaking with Nicholas, head south-southwest on the trail as he has instructed and you will find
Rupert the Farmer. Rupert also gives you a quest.</P>

<P>At this point you should fight rabbits and rats to gain a few levels. After you have completed Rupert's
quest, the world is yours for the exploration. Head north onto the peninsula and explore everywhere. If you
meet a few other players on your journey, it would be a good idea to form a group and create a fellowship.
Fellowships will help you to grow strong quickly and they are a key to survival.
