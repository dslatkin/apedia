This is a very old website that I took over maintenance for from a person who
went by the in-game name "Trance" way back in June 2003. It was the primary
reference site for a 2D multiplayer online fantasy role-playing game called
[Whispers in
Akarra](https://web.archive.org/web/20040325013734/http://akarra.net/), the game
itself a hobby project created by [Jens
Bergenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Bergensten), now the lead
developer and designer for Minecraft).

I have since converted the "Apedia" as it was affectionately called to a static
site hosted on Vercel, with the only _very minor_ change to the original code
being to replace an old bit of PHP I had used to render a "cool random weapon"
on the home page of the site. If you're curious about the old web, I encourage
you to check out [the home page](/src/app.html) or [the drop-down
menu](/static/scripts/menu.js).
