              <p>Hey all,</p>
              <p>
                Talonz here, dropping in after what, more than 16 years since
                the last update? If you're a former Whispers in Akarra player or
                a bit curious about this game, you should check out the
                following projects and communities working to keep active
                servers running that people can still play:
              <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://peateasix.itch.io/whispers-in-akarra-mostly-vanilla">Whispers in Akarra - Mostly Vanilla</a>
                    (<a href="https://discord.gg/ku9esWFFR2">Discord</a>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://akarrax2.com/">Akarra X2</a>
                    (<a href="https://discord.gg/HHRRnGZ">Discord</a>)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Additionally, you can always check out <a
                href="https://akarra.com">akarra.com</a>
                for even more news and information. The venerable Luna keeps it
                running. If you'd like to get your site, server, or project
                added to this list, I'm sure you can manage to find me on one of
                those Discord servers. ;)
              </p>
              <p>Until next time...</p>

                <p>It's been almost a year since the last update. Since the server
                has been down, people have been idling in the IRC channel #akarra.
                There has been news of a great game in the works though,
                <a href="http://www.dawnofdaria.com/">Dawn of Daria</a>. It is being
                managed by thewreck, former member of the Akarrian devteam. :)
                I have already started an encyclopedia for it, as thin as its
                pages may be. It can be seen <a href="http://dapedia.talonz.com/">here</a>.</p>
                <p>In more recent news, the server files (NOT the source code heh)
                have been released to the public courtesy of khaile - thanks man!
                Now we can put up our own servers, register new people, etc etc.
                Origon has the largest one so far I believe, and braiba is working
                on getting a customized server of his up. If you are interested
                in playing Akarra again (though you would have to restart everything)
                please check out <a href="http://www.oxeye.se/forums/viewforum.php?f=7">the
                Akarra section of Khaile's dev forums</a>. :)</p>
                <p>This site will probably remain unchanged. It is off Luke's server
                and now I'm getting quality hosting that I pay for, so it should
                be up 24/7 lag free. At the time of this writing, I'm playing on
                Origon's server, so ask him to join. Cya in Akarra!</p>
